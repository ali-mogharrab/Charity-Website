# Charity Website

The general mechanism of this Website is that charity institutions define their needs in the form of a project and benefactors choose the item or items that are compatible with their ability and time from among these needs and apply for it.
The charity institution can reject or accept the benefactor's request.

- Users (whether Charities or Benefactors) can join this system.
- Benefactors can apply for a need they wish to fulfill.
- Institutions can accept according to the circumstances whether this act is done by this benefactor or not.
- Institutions can declare a requirement as finished when it is finished.
